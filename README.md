#**Project 1 - Texas Holdem**

My game project will be to create a standard 2 player Texas Holdem game, and possibly Blackjack depending on how much time I have and how much content can be recycled between the two games. 

Core Functions of **Texas Holdem**:
 1. Two players (head to head)
 2. Flop 3 cards, then a fourth, and river
 3. Call / Raise / Fold option on each turn
 4. Game must evaluate the winner** (not fun)

Optional Functions of **Texas Holdem**:
* Some animation effects
* Up to 5 players
* Dynamic side notes and tips for beginners 
* Style the game background and elements like a real table
* Add my own rules to the game

Core Functions of **Blackjack**:



One - Two players (Player vs Dealer)
 1. Each player draws 2 cards to start
 2.  Stay / Hit option on each turn
 3. Dealer goes last - hits on anything < hard 17
 4. Game must evaluate the winner 

Optional Functions of **Blackjack**:
* Some animation effects
* Up to 5 players
* Dynamic calculation of odds
* Style the game background and elements like a real table
